* Introduction

The contents of most web sites are formatted in ill-structured HTML,
makes it extremely difficult to incorporate other site's services into
your own. Even if such hand-coded attempts are made, the lack of
streamlined representation forbids you from integrating other service's
contents, or re-formats them into the same style.

This project aims to provide a set of utilities for streamlining the
process of sending multiple queries, converting them into your own
format, and build full-text index for future searchs.

See the manpage of OurNet::Query for more information.
